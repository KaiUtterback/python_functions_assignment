'''
Create a simple program that greets users and responds based on their input

Task 1: Code a program  that asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting.
Task 2: Modify the program to ask the user how they are feeling today and respond with a comforting message if they're feeling down, 
or a cheerful one if they're feeling happy.
Task 3: Add error handling to ensure that the user inputs a string for the name and not anumber or special character.
